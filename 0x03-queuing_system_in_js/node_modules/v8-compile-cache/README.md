# v8-compile-cache

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zertosh/v8-compile-cache.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zertosh/v8-compile-cache)

`v8-compile-cache` attaches a `require` hook to use [V8's code cache](https://v8project.blogspot.com/2015/07/code-caching.html) to speed up instantiation time. The "code cache" is the work of parsing and compiling done by V8.

The ability to tap into V8 to produce/consume this cache was introduced in [Node v5.7.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v5.7.0/)
